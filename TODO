TODO
----

* peadmin
  * basic administrative features
  * possible editing features in the browser?
* Finish moving all non-kernel tasks to modules
* Add a sandbox in which to render views
  * Sandboxing for real requires 5.3 and some other fancy stuff
    that really is beyond the scope of pea. Let's fake it by enforcing
    rendering as the last action and moving everything necessary to the global
    namespace. I know, I know...
* Exceptions and a pretty exception handler for development.
* Modules should be able to automatically mixin
  to certain classes
  * This no longer seems necessary since the modules now completely
    handle this stuff. That having been said, it was an interesting
    problem and one I would still like to think about solving.
  * mixin:
      sqloopBase: models
      superController: controllers

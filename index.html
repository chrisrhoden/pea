    <div class="description">
      pea is a browser-based development environment for non-programmers.
    </div>

    <p>
      As of now, pea is a simple little framework, written in PHP, which is designed to run on the LAMP
      stack. It's been rewritten and is now entirely OO. It's quite fast and extremely modular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the way that pea and the pod(module) system was designed, it's mostly just a very
      lightweight MVC framework which can be extended. Pods are extremely powerful, and can be set
      up to completely rewrite the page or hijack 404 errors.
    </p>
    <h2>Dependencies</h2>
    <p>
      Because pea is designed to take advantage of the LAMP stack to the fullest, it is not
      fully compatible with any other webservers, database engines, or operating systems
      at this time. All testing is being done on this platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHP 5 is required for higher-level object-oriented code in PHP, so it is a dependency
      of pea.
    </p>
    <h2>Install</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, installation is not currently a easy as we would like it to be in the future.
      You can obtain tarballs or zipped archives of the code from this page, extract them on your
      webserver, and set the document root to the ``public'' directory within the project hierarchy.
      From there, you only need to edit configuration files, which, by convention, are stored in the
      ``config'' directory.
    </p>

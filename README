Nothing here is intended to be of any value, as I have decided to take
what I once had and throw it into the air, scramble it about, lay it
out neatly on silk in an entirely new configuration, bake it for 18
hours in a 600 degree oven, and then trow it all out. Please do not
(seriously, just don't) try to use any of this to predict where I am
going with the project or in any capacity that might affect anyone at
all. Dire consequences will most certainly ensue.
